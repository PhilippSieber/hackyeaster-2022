Later that year, I was travelling again. Find out where I shot this picture! This time, I want GPS coordinates.

ðŸš© Flag
- GPS coordinates, **rounded** to three decimals
- `,` as separator
- `.` as decimal point
- example:
  - 40Â°46'30.3"N 73Â°57'59.8"W
  - 40.775082, -73.966599 
  - `he2022{40.775,-73.967}`
